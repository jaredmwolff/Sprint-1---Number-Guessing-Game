# Overview

The purpose of this Sprint is to familiarize myself with the Java Coding Language. Considering my current schedule with my full-time job and my other classes, I wanted to accomplish this without overloading myself with work.

The code provided utilizes a Number Guessing Game. Within 5 attempts, you will make guesses as to what the random number is.

My purpose, again, is to familiarize myself with the Java Coding Language.

# Future Work

- Utilize more sources in my studies.
- Attempt to be more creative/complicated with the assignments since a Number Guessing Game is short by nature...
- Become more comfortable seeking help when I hit a stump in the coding process.
